<strong>Discalimer: This code is crown property.</strong>



Featured below is the create page for making new documents! 

Front End:
----------
I worked on the position of the elements under Decision Request information.

I added in file number and URL selections which give prompts for the user and do verification depending on which input type they pick.

I made the page more intuitive by changing the placement of buttons on the page.

I added in cursor and shading changes when a user scrolls over panels on the page, as this page features drag-and-drop functionality.

Back End:
---------
The source code I wrote that gets called when the "Save Button" is clicked can be viewed!
